The assets folder contains files required to run including fonts, local data files and text files. Generally accessible through the 
generated assets class. More info can be found here - https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/application_fundamentals/resources_in_android/part_6_-_using_android_assets/


Any raw assets you want to be deployed with your application can be placed in
this directory (and child directories) and given a Build Action of "AndroidAsset".

These files will be deployed with you package and will be accessible using Android's
AssetManager, like this:

public class ReadAsset : Activity
{
	protected override void OnCreate (Bundle bundle)
	{
		base.OnCreate (bundle);

		InputStream input = Assets.Open ("my_asset.txt");
	}
}

Additionally, some Android functions will automatically load asset files:

Typeface tf = Typeface.CreateFromAsset (Context.Assets, "fonts/samplefont.ttf");
